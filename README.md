# Festival Poster

Created to display all the bands I've ever seen, in an A-series aspect ratio.

To update the HTML, run the following in the root of this repo:

```sh
python create-poster.py
```

To create a PDF, I printed with the following settings in Google Chrome. Other browsers printed this less nicely.

- **Layout:** Portrait
- **Pages:** Custom -> 1
- **Paper Size:** A3
- **Margins:** None
- **Scale:** Custom -> 80
- **Layout:** Portrait
